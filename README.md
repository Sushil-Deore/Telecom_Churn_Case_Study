# Telecom_Churn_Case_Study

A telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:  

- Demographics (age, gender etc.) 
- Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.) 
- Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.) 

Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. 

It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.
